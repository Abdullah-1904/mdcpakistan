      // This script handles the redirection for GitHub Pages when a direct URL or refresh occurs.
      // It is specifically tailored for custom domains where the repository name
      // is NOT part of the URL path (e.g., mdcpakistan.com/contact instead of mdcpakistan.github.io/mdcpakistan/contact).

      // The base path for a custom domain served by GitHub Pages is always the root '/'.
      const basePath = "/";

      // Get the current path without the leading slash (e.g., 'contact' from '/contact').
      // This is the path that React Router expects.
      const currentPath = window.location.pathname.slice(1);

      // Get any query parameters (e.g., '?param=value').
      const queryParams = window.location.search;

      // Construct the full target URL.
      // We are redirecting to the root of your domain, and then letting React Router
      // handle the original path.
      // Example: For mdcpakistan.com/contact, it redirects to mdcpakistan.com/?path=/contact
      // However, the cleanest way is to redirect to the root and let React Router pick up the path.
      // The previous script was attempting to reconstruct the path, which might be
      // causing the loop if the server is still returning 404 for the reconstructed path.

      // The most robust solution is to redirect simply to the base (index.html)
      // and let React Router handle the *current* window.location.pathname directly.
      // The browser's URL will remain the same, but the content will be driven by index.html.

      // A common method is to store the target path in session storage or local storage,
      // then redirect to the root, and have your React app read that path.
      // However, a simpler direct redirect often works:

      // Check if the current path is already the root. If it is, no redirect is needed.
      // This prevents the infinite loop if we are already at the root of the app.
      if (
        window.location.pathname === basePath ||
        window.location.pathname === `${basePath}index.html`
      ) {
        // Already at the root or index.html, no redirection needed to avoid loop.
        console.log("Already at base path or index.html, no redirect needed.");
      } else {
        // Store the full original path and query string before redirection.
        // This allows the React app to retrieve it and navigate correctly.
        sessionStorage.setItem(
          "redirectPath",
          window.location.pathname + window.location.search
        );

        // Redirect to the root of your application.
        // After this, your React app (index.html) will load, read 'redirectPath',
        // and use React Router to navigate to the correct internal route.
        window.location.replace(basePath);
